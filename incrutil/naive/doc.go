/*
package naive provides basic implementations of incremental primitives to test what a "baseline" implementation of a DAG would perform like _before_ you add incremental.

The goal here is to show that for _many_ use cases, incremental is overkill and just adds overhead.

Obvious caveat is obvious, but you should not actually use this package and there are zero guarantees with it.
